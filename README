I love the Clipper app for the Mac but I hate that if you restart or if you copy a lot of things you loose older items.  This utility will sit in the background(takes up like 15mb of memory) and sends all of your string copys to a server to store them in a database. Once they're in the database you can do what you want with them.

Feel free to change it around, some ideas I had were:
- Tag pastes based on their content. For example SQL, PHP, HTML, URLs would be tagged and have individual pages that show just these items.
- Show the history in the dropdown like so many apps
- Delete useless pastes

Requirments:
- PHP/mySQL (or something other language if you want to rewrite the script)
- XCode
- A Mac

To Install:
1.) Run the sql file on your server to create the database/table
2.) Setup permissions for that table and set them in the everpaste.php file
3.) Install the everpaste.php file on your server
4.) Compile the XCode project and run it.
5.) In your status bar select the EverPaste icon and choose Settings. Change the URL to your server url with the full path to the everpaste.php file
6.) Enjoy.
