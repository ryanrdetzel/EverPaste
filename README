Feel free to change it around, some ideas I had were:

- Tag pasts based on their content. SQL, PHP, HTML, URLs, etc and have pages that show just those.
- Show the pasts in the dropdown like so many apps
- Delete useless pastes

Requirments:
- PHP/mySQL
- XCode
- A Mac

To Install:
1.) Run the sql file on your server to create the database/table
2.) Setup permissions for that table and set them in the everpaste.php file
3.) Install the everpaste.php file on your server
4.) Compile the XCode project and run it.
5.) In your status bar select the EverPaste icon and choose Settings. Change the URL to your server url with the full path to the everpaste.php file
6.) Enjoy.
